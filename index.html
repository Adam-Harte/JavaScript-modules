		<h1>JavaScript Modules</h1>
		<h3>Modules</h3>
		<p>
			Modules allows us to export and import pieces/modules of JavaScript code
			to be used in other files that require the fnctionality. This allows us to
			seperate our JavaScript code into smaller files for certain
			functionalities to then be used in other files as and when needed. One of
			the big differences with modules is when we export code it gets locked
			down to its own scope in that file meaning anything we want to change with
			that speciifc functionality can only be accessed and changed in that file
			and it isnt part of a global scope that can be accessed and changed.
		</p>
		<h3>Named Exports and Imports</h3>
		<p>
			We can export specific peices of code such as functions, variables etc.
			with named exports. By simply adding the 'export' keyword before the
			function or variable decalration we are then doing the so called named
			export of that piece of code. To then import this exported code and use it
			in another file we need to named import it. We import named exports by
			using the keyword 'import' followed by curly braces with the named modules
			exported inside the curly braces. You then finish the import declaration
			with the from path of the file tha holds the exported code.
		</p>
		<h3>Combined Imports</h3>
		<p>
			We also have another way we can import named exports with a combined
			import that groups all the named exports of the specified file into one
			object. We use the import syntax but instead of the curly braces and named
			export we use a star '*' followed by as and then a name for the object
			that will hold all the named exports. You can alos add the as alias in a
			named import in the curly brace to give one named import a speicifc new
			alias.
		</p>
		<h3>Default Export and Imports</h3>
		<p>
			We can export a piece of code in a file and make it the default export of
			that file with the 'export default' keywords. When we then go to import
			this default export we can omit the curly braces and the name of the
			export and instead any name we pass it will becomes the name of the
			default export we are importing.
		</p>
		<h3>Dynamic Imports and Code Splitting</h3>
		<p>
			We can dynamically import exported code as and when we need it by calling
			import as a function. We would do this to reduce the amount of requests we
			are making for files on the initial page load as any code we export and
			import in our scripts at the start of executon must be donwlaoded at
			runtime on page load, so any functionality we do not need straight away
			can instead be dynamically imported later on and therfore speedup initail
			page load and performance. We call import as a function with the argument
			being a string of the path to the file we want to import. This function
			returns a promise allowing us to then use promie chaining to access
			specific vairables, objects, function etc of the module we have imported.

		<h1>JavaScript Modules</h1>
		<h3>Modules</h3>
		<p>
			Modules allows us to export and import pieces/modules of JavaScript code
			to be used in other files that require the fnctionality. This allows us to
			seperate our JavaScript code into smaller files for certain
			functionalities to then be used in other files as and when needed. One of
			the big differences with modules is when we export code it gets locked
			down to its own scope in that file meaning anything we want to change with
			that speciifc functionality can only be accessed and changed in that file
			and it isnt part of a global scope that can be accessed and changed.
		</p>
		<h3>Named Exports and Imports</h3>
		<p>
			We can export specific peices of code such as functions, variables etc.
			with named exports. By simply adding the 'export' keyword before the
			function or variable decalration we are then doing the so called named
			export of that piece of code. To then import this exported code and use it
			in another file we need to named import it. We import named exports by
			using the keyword 'import' followed by curly braces with the named modules
			exported inside the curly braces. You then finish the import declaration
			with the from path of the file tha holds the exported code.
		</p>
		<h3>Combined Imports</h3>
		<p>
			We also have another way we can import named exports with a combined
			import that groups all the named exports of the specified file into one
			object. We use the import syntax but instead of the curly braces and named
			export we use a star '*' followed by as and then a name for the object
			that will hold all the named exports.

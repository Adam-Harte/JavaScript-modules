		<h3>Modules</h3>
		<p>
			Modules allows us to export and import pieces/modules of JavaScript code
			to be used in other files that require the fnctionality. This allows us to
			seperate our JavaScript code into smaller files for certain
			functionalities to then be used in other files as and when needed. One of
			the big differences with modules is when we export code it gets locked
			down to its own scope in that file meaning anything we want to change with
			that speciifc functionality can only be accessed and changed in that file
			and it isnt part of a global scope that can be accessed and changed.
